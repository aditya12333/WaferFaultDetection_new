# WaferFaultDetection

## Problem Statement:

**To build a classification methodology to predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data.**

## DataSet

 The data set contains the 590 columns of different sensor value for each columns. The last columns values represents the good and values of each wafer.
 +1 represents the bad wafer./n
 -1 represents the good wafer.
